<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size: 35px;color:#000;">Shree Somnath Jyotirlinga Temple<p>
<img src="img/somnath-temple-banner.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
<b style="color:#000;">About The Location :</b>The intricately carved honey-coloured Somnath temple on the western edge of the state is believed to be the place where the first of the twelve holy jyotirlingas emerged in India – a spot where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. The temples lies at the meeting of Kapila, Hiran and Sarasvati rivers and the waves of the Arabian Sea ebb and flow touching the shore on which it is constructed. The ancient temple’s timeline can be traced from 649 BC but is believed to be older than that. The present form was reconstructed in 1951. Colourful dioramas of the Shiva story line the north side of the temple garden, though it’s hard to see them through the hazy glass. A one-hour sound-and-light show in Amitabh Bachchan’s baritone highlights the temple nightly at 7.45pm.
</p>

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
<b style="color:#000;">Brief History:</b>t’s said that Somraj (the moon god) first built a temple in Somnath, made of gold; this was rebuilt by Ravana in silver, by Krishna in wood and by Bhimdev in stone. The current serene, symmetrical structure was built to traditional designs on the original coastal site: it’s painted a creamy colour and boasts a little fine sculpture. The large, black Shiva lingam at its heart is one of the 12 most sacred Shiva shrines, known as jyotirlinga.

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size: 35px;color:#000;">Dwarkadhish Temple<p>
<img src="img/Dwarkadhish-Temple-1.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About The Location:</b> The main draw for tourists coming to Dwarka, the Dwarkadhish Temple (Jagat Mandir), is believed to have been established more than 2500 years ago by Lord Krishna’s great grandson, Vajranabh. The ancient temple has been renovated several times, especially leaving imprints of 16th and 19th centuries. The temple stands on a small hill accessed by 50 plus steps, with heavily sculptured walls that cocoon the sanctum with the main Krishna idol. Around the complex lie other smaller shrines. The walls have intricately carved mythical characters and legends. The impressive 43 m high spire is topped with a flag made from 52 yards of cloth that flutters in the soft breeze from the Arabian Sea behind the temple. There are two doors (swarg and moksh) for the entry and exit of the temple. A bridge called Sudama Setu (7am–1pm, 4–7.30pm) at the base of the temple takes one across the Gomti creek towards the beach.

The red building lies at a short distance from the town. At the end of a large hall is the main sanctum with the shivalinga. Close to the temple is another important spiritual spot called Gopi Talav Tirth, a lake that is connected to the legends of gopis visiting Lord Krishna and eventually offering their lives to merge with the soil here.

Hindu pilgrims were coming to visit this temple from long before the development of Champaner as a major city, and they continued for hundreds of years after its decline, right up to the present day. To reach the temple at the summit is about a 5 km walk along a jungle footpath to the top of the hill; otherwise, there is a cable car that will haul you to the summit from about the midway point, which is the last place accessible by road. The temple has large fortifications and an open chowk in front, with two altars for sacrifices, and an array of lights for special occasions. The idol of Kalika Mata in the inner sanctum is only the head, the mukhwato, painted in red. Also present are full idols of Mahakali and the yantras of Bahuchara. The temple is open from very early to quite late, to accommodate pilgrims arriving at all hours. The Machi Haveli is a rest house available for pilgrims.

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b>Nishkalank Mahadev Temple is a Hindu temple located at Koliyak near Bhavnagar, Gujarat. Situated in Koliyak Beach, it is one of the rarest sea temples in India you must include in your Gujarat trip and among the most visited places of pilgrimage in Bhavnagar.  
</p>
<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    Located about a kilometer into the sea, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple has 5 distinct swayambhu Shiva lingams on a square platform and each is having a Nandi statue facing it. This temple is submerged during high tides in the sea and emerges during low tides to reveal itself majestically, promising its devotees to wash away all sins. During the high tide, the idol of the lord is submerged and all that can be seen are the flag and a pillar. The temple was built with special care to withstand high tides and it truly remains an unsolved mystery to modern engineers and technology experts.

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size: 35px;color:#000;">Hutheesing Jain Temple<p>
<img src="img/Hutheesing-Jain-Temple-Banner.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b>  This remarkably elegant temple created out of white marble has been sacred to many Jain families, generation after generation. It was built in 1848 A.D. at an estimated cost of 10 lakh rupees by a rich merchant Sheth Hutheesing as a dedication to the 15th Jain Tirthankara, Shri Dharmanatha. Traditional artisans working in stone belonged to the Sonpura & Salat communities. The Salat community constructed masterpieces of architecture ranging from forts, palaces to temples. The work of the Hutheesing Jain temple is attributed to Premchand Salat. One scholar has remarked, "Each part goes on increasing in dignity as we approach the sanctuary. Whether looked at from its courts or from the outside, it possesses variety without confusion and appropriateness of every part to the purpose for which it was intended."

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> The Sidi Sayed Mosque is famed for its exquisite jali windows, spider web fine, depicting the intricate intertwining branches of the ‘tree of life’ that is best seen from the road that runs along the back of the mosque. The central arch of the mosque is also bereft of the intricate latticework, making the eyes go straight to the main stunning work at the back wall. The mosque still functions as a place of prayer.

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> The hustling, dusty town of Palitana, 51 km southwest of Bhavnagar, has grown rapidly to serve the pilgrim trade around the Shatrunjaya Hill. The sacred site contains hundreds of shrines that were sanctified when Rishabha, the first Tirthankara of Jainism, gave his first sermon in the temple on the hilltop. Even though the climb to the temples is a rigorous one, it awards a dazzling sight of the intricately carved temples. During the Kartik Purnima festival, accommodation around town floods with pilgrims and is best booked in advance.

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size: 35px;color:#000;">Bhadreshwar Jain Tirth Derasar<p>
<img src="img/Bhadreshwar-Thumbnail.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> Perhaps one of the most under-appreciated sites of great significance for India's religious history is Bhadreshwar, barely a kilometer from the coast, 69 km east of Mandvi, past Mundra, and 75 km south of Bhuj. The Jain religion, like other religions of Indian origin, places considerable importance on the act of pilgrimage and Bhadreshwar is one of the major centers of Jain pilgrimage in Gujarat. Unreliable reports claim the city was founded in 516 BC, and oral accounts state that the first temple was built “2500 years ago, about 45 years after the death of Lord Mahavir,” but there is no evidence to either support or debunk that claim. The main temple is strikingly beautiful, in all white marble with majestic pillars. Around the central one are 52 smaller shrines, one of which reputedly holds the original Parshavanath idol from 500 BC Non-Jains cannot spend the night in the temple complex, but other lodging is available in town.

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size: 35px;color:#000;">Khodiyar Mandir<p>
<img src="img/Khodiyar-Mataji-Temple-Thumbnail.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> ven though the Khodiyar temple, on the outskirts of Bhavnagar (15km), was built only as recent as early 20th century, it has a staunch following amongst devotees of Janbai (Khodiyar Ma). The temple lies on the edge of the Tataniya Wali Lake and has a ropeway at the back that connects the base to a shrine on the top of a hill. Lapsi (broken wheat dessert) is the main prasad of the temple.

<img src="img/Koteshwar-Mahadev-Temple-1.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> After traveling over the expanse of desert in western Kutch, you find the Koteshwar Temple, at a place where the immensity of dry land meets the incomprehensible vastness of the sea. After so much arid ground, the sight of the ocean will awaken your spirits; though the sea is even less hospitable to humans, a sobering thought. The only point that breaks the skyline from the flat brown horizon to the east and the wide blue horizon to the west is the point of the Koteshwar Temple, the last outpost of human construction at the westernmost limit of India. Not overrun by tourists like the temple at Dwarka, Koteshwar is conducive to contemplating emptiness, pondering the place of humanity on earth (and ultimately, isn’t that what spiritual traditions are about?).

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> Located relatively on the outskirts, the Rukmini Mata Temple commemorates Lord Krishna’s queen. The temple is said to be more than 2500 years old but it may have been reconstructed over time. The present temple is said to belong to the 12th century. It is much more modest than Dwarkadhish in structure and sculptures but inspires the same devotional fervour. Carvings of gods and goddesses embellish the exteriors and the main idol of Rukmini is housed in the sanctum. Carved naratharas (human figures) and gajatharas (elephants) feature in the panels at the base of the platform.

<p style="margin-left:10px;font-size:20px; padding-top:10px;">
    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> Akshardham is a majestic, intricately carved stone structure that stands amid sprawling gardens set in a 23-acre plot at Gandhinagar (Gandhinagar district). It is built in 6000 tonnes of pink sandstone and not a bit of steel has been used. The temple is 108 ft in height, 240 ft in length and 131 ft in width. A point worth noting is that this modern monument to Hinduism was built as per the injunctions of Vastu Shastra. The monument enshrining the seven-foot high, gold-leafed Murti (idol) of Lord Swaminarayan is the focal point of the complex.

    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> A sprawling lake on the western most edge of India, Narayan Sarovar has great spiritual significance. This is one of the 5 holy lakes of Hinduism, along with Mansarovar in Tibet, Pampa in Karnataka, Bhuvaneshwar in Orissa and Pushkar in Rajasthan, and is considered a coveted place for a holy dip. An adjoining temple built by the wife of Maharao Desalji features shrines of Shri Trikamraiji, Laxminarayan, Govardhannathji, Dwarkanath, Adinarayan, Ranchodraiji and Laxmiji. A short drive from here, the Koteshwar Mahadev Temple is a grand sandstone structure that overlooks a marshy sea. Shrines dedicated to Shiva and Ganesha are the highlights here.

The temple is covered with 8 domes and 24 turrets, with the central dome reaching a height of 27 m. Crowned with a golden kalash and a white silken flag, this temple is the tallest in the district. Though not very rich in carving, the main cupola derives its influence from the Maharashtrian style of temple architecture. The main hall features paintings depicting events in Lord Krishna’s life.

    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> Constructed in the early 20th century, the Sudama temple stands in the middle of the bustling market area of Porbandar. The light pink temple stands amidst a copse of trees, which offer shade to the visitors. The temple has been built to commemorate the friendship between Lord Krishna and his trusted friend, Sudama. The temple is simple but adorned with marble pillars and an intricately sculpted shikhara. It also has a small stepwell in the complex.

On reaching you can see small shrines dedicated to Buddhist Goddess, Devi Taranamata. Weathered terracotta images of Buddha and four carved images of Dhyani Buddha on a stone plate can be seen in cave formations. The Taranga Jain Temple is further up from here. This 12th century derasar is one of the best-preserved temples in Gujarat. There is a five-metre tall sculpture of the 2nd Jain Tirthankara, Shri Ajitnath, who represents inner stillness. The Svetambara complex consists of 14 temples, but there are 5 other Digambara shrines as well.

    <b style="color:#000;">About the location:</b> The glorious, multi-coloured, wood carved Swaminarayan Temple in the old city, was built in 1822 as the first temple of the Swaminarayan Hindu sect. Followers believe the sect’s founder, Swaminarayan (1781–1830), was the Supreme Being. The start of the daily Heritage Walk here at 8am usually coincides with worship at the temple, with devotees thronging the venue. Each paneling is made of Burma teak wood with artistic embellishments. The gateway sculptures have Rajasthani costumes and colours as well.
